. Project: Amazon co-purchasing analysis
Related Industry: online commercial/Business
Data: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon-meta.html
The data was collected by crawling Amazon website and contains
product metadata and review information about 548,552 different
products (Books, music CDs, DVDs and VHS video tapes).
Suggested Problem: Implement a co-purchasing data analytics engine
using NoSQL database, Hadoop MapReduce and/or Apache Spark
MLlib. The analyzer has the following functions:
1. Answer complex query. We define a query Q of the form ‘SELECT *
FROM U WHERE Condition’. The CONDITION is of the following
forms:
- Searchable attributes: value constraints over well-defined attributes
in node/edge schema
- Non-searchable attributes: attributes that cannot be queried directly
over existing attributes: the number of reviews of a product, the
number of customers co- purchasing same product of a user.
- Queries with enriched operators: >, >=, =, <, <=; e.g., Select movie
with average rating >=4.5
Given a query Q and Amazon dataset, and a number k, find k entities
that satisfy Q with minimized evaluation cost.
Note: While the query Q is SQL-like, its implementation should be non-
SQL based.
2. Find potential customers that satisfies co-purchasing pattern:
- Divide the co-purchasing data into two data set, one we call
“training” dataset, and the other “testing” dataset. Verify several
frequent co-purchasing patterns in the training dataset. Report the
frequency in the testing dataset. For those frequent patterns in both
dataset, return the customers captured by the patterns.
- What seems to be the most significant co-purchasing pattern?
